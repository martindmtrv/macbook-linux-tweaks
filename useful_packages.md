Eventually would like this to be a automatic install script:

# packages AUR incl.

| package | why? |
| ------- | ---- |
| vlc | media player |
| mbpfan | enable more gradual fan RPMs |
| auto-cpufreq | switch CPU governors (for power saving) |
| virt-manager | GUI for KVM qEMU |
| visual-studio-code-bin | vscode from AUR |
| waydroid | android emu native |
| gparted | manage partitions in GUI |
| backintime | snapshot backups |

| zoom | need it hopefully screen share fix wayland |
| spotify | music |
| obs | recording software |

add more as they come ...


# Gnome tweaks
